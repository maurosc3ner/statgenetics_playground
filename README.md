# Statistical Genetics Playground
This is my playground repo for my learning process of statistical genetics. Here, I focus on try to complete a typical stack of stats related task. Classical models from the basics (QC, prunning) to the more complex ones (population stratification, ancestry, PRS) are part of this repository notebooks.

## Frameworks and Tools
1. PLINK 
2. R
3. Hail (Python)

## Topics
1. Basics of Plink (I, II), [URL]()
2. GWAS
   * QC in Python ([All of Us' example]())
   * Population stratification in Hail ([All of Us' example]())
3. Ancestry ([URL]())
4. Polygenic risk scores (PRS)
   * QC ([Part 1](https://github.com/maurosc3ner/statgenetics_playground/blob/main/PRS_tutorial_part1.md))
   * C+T ([Par 2](https://github.com/maurosc3ner/statgenetics_playground/blob/main/PRS_tutorial_part2.md))
